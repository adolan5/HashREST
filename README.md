# HashREST

*A simple REST server project that runs some proof-of-work like hashing based on
inputs.*

## Goals

This project serves little functional purpose other than as a place to learn
more about GitHub's CI/CD integrations. Building out this simple system provides
an opportunity to use the development process with GitHub's Actions in order to
learn more about container-based CI/CD.
